INSURANCE PREMIUM PREDICTION

The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health
insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our

insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.

Penetration of Insurance facility is very less till date in the world.
People are unaware of the fact that they can insure their earning memberâ€™s life and health by buying life and health insurance.
For more awareness of insurance facility, many companies hired agents to go and make people aware in various corners of the world. 
In this system, the agents sometimes try to sell the most highly premium insurance products to the customers.
It becomes very difficult for the people to buy such highly priced life and health insurances. 
The insurances are based on certain factors like age, sex, medical situation of the customer. 
Depending on various such factors, the premium of the insurance policy is fixed.
Our prediction model will predict the exact premium amount one needs to pay to buy a life and health insurance.
